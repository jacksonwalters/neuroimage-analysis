# neuroimage-analysis
This script provides a basic visualization of brain scans in MATLAB.

Currently it computes basic statistics and produces two animations.

The first animation fixes the spatial slice in the z-axis and iterates over time. The output is a .gif file.

The second animation moves through the 2d slices in the z-axis to create a spatial animation. The output is a .gif file.
