# neuroimage-analysis
This script provides a basic visualization of brain scans in MATLAB.

Currently the `ds000114_sub_01_analysis.m` script:
  - computes basic statistics
  - produces two animations [temporal, spatial] as .gif files
  - outputs a time series for a given voxel

**potential future topics**:
- multi-modal studies [combining different data types; genetic, questionaire data, GWAS etc.]
- neurodegenerative bases for disorders such as bipolar, schizophrenia [e.g. myelin sheath decay]
